    <h3>1. What are Optical Transients?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Astrophysical transients</strong> are short-lived celestial events that appear and evolve rapidly across the sky, often due to energetic phenomena like stellar explosions, compact object mergers, or accretion instabilities. These include <em>supernovae</em>, <em>gamma-ray bursts</em>, <em>kilonovae</em>, and <em>tidal disruption events</em>. Studying transients helps us probe the extreme physics of the universe and explore connections between light, gravitational waves, and high-energy particles in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

    <h3>2. Discoveries and Follow-up</h3>

            Discovery and follow-up of <strong>astrophysical transients</strong> rely on a network of wide-field and targeted telescopes. The <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a> scans large areas of the northern sky every night, rapidly identifying new transients such as supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, and kilonova candidates. The <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/victor-blanco-4m-telescope/decam/" target="_blank">Dark Energy Camera (DECam)</a> on the Blanco 4m telescope offers deep imaging capabilities crucial for follow-up of faint or distant events, especially those triggered by gravitational wave detections. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/" target="_blank">GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT)</a>, a 70-cm robotic facility, complements this effort by enabling high-cadence monitoring from India, improving temporal coverage and enabling rapid photometric characterization. Together, these facilities form a powerful global network for real-time transient science and multi-messenger astronomy.
