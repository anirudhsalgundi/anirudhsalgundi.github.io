  <h3>1. What are X-ray Binaries?</h3>
  <p>
    X-ray binaries are binary star systems composed of a compact object, either a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) accreting matter from a companion star. Based on the companion’s mass and evolutionary stage, they are classified into low-mass and high-mass X-ray binaries. In these systems, accretion occurs via Roche-lobe overflow or stellar winds, generating powerful X-ray emission due to the gravitational energy released by infalling matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>neutron star X-ray binaries</strong> (NSXBs), accretion can lead to observable surface phenomena like thermonuclear bursts and pulsations. In <strong>black hole X-ray binaries</strong> (BHXBs), the lack of a solid surface leads to different spectral and timing behavior, though both display transitions between spectral states (hard, soft, intermediate) regulated by changes in the accretion flow.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Type I X-ray bursts</h3>

  <p>
    Thermonuclear bursts, also known as Type I X-ray bursts, are sudden and intense flashes of X-rays originating from the surface of accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. They occur due to unstable nuclear burning of hydrogen- and helium-rich material accumulated from the companion star. When the temperature and pressure in the accreted layer reach critical thresholds, runaway nuclear fusion ignites, releasing a burst of energy within seconds. These bursts offer unique insights into the physics of neutron star surfaces, nuclear processes at extreme densities, and the equation of state of ultra-dense matter.

          <p>
            A remarkable phenomenon associated with these bursts is the occurrence of <strong>burst oscillations</strong>—nearly coherent modulations in X-ray intensity observed during the rise or decay of some bursts. These oscillations are interpreted as the spin signature of the neutron star, caused by rotational modulation of surface brightness asymmetries during thermonuclear burning. Measuring burst oscillation frequencies allows astronomers to estimate neutron star spin rates with high precision and investigate the coupling between the star’s surface and its magnetosphere.

    Additionally, phenomena such as <em>photospheric radius expansion</em> (PRE) during certain bursts provide a means to estimate source distances and constrain surface gravity. Thus, thermonuclear bursts—especially those exhibiting burst oscillations—serve as powerful probes of neutron star structure, nuclear physics under extreme conditions, and the complex interactions between accretion flows and compact stellar remnants.

  <h3>4. Rapid X-ray Variability and Quasi-periodic Oscillations</h3>
  <p>
    Accreting compact objects exhibit rapid X-ray variability on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds, reflecting the dynamics of matter in the innermost regions of the accretion flow. A significant component of this variability manifests as <strong>quasi-periodic oscillations</strong> (QPOs)—narrow features in the X-ray power density spectrum that indicate the presence of coherent or semi-coherent oscillatory processes near the compact object. These oscillations are believed to arise from geometric or dynamical modulations in the inner accretion disk, boundary layer, or corona.

          <p>
            <strong>Low-frequency QPOs</strong> (LFQPOs), typically occurring in the range of 0.1–30 Hz, are commonly observed in both black hole and neutron star systems. They are associated with changes in the geometry of the accretion disk or inner hot flow and often correlate with spectral states. LFQPOs are classified into types A, B, and C in black hole binaries based on properties like centroid frequency, amplitude, coherence (Q-factor), and harmonic structure. For example, in the 2021 outburst of GX 339–4, AstroSat observations revealed type-B LFQPOs near 5 Hz, with harmonics and sub-harmonics that evolved over time. These are often interpreted within the framework of Lense–Thirring precession or shock oscillation models, probing general relativistic effects near the event horizon.

          <p>
            At much higher frequencies, <strong>kilohertz QPOs</strong> (kHz QPOs) are observed exclusively in neutron star systems, typically ranging from 300 to 1200 Hz. These are among the fastest known variabilities in X-ray binaries and originate in regions only a few kilometers from the neutron star surface. kHz QPOs often appear as twin peaks—upper and lower QPOs—with a variable frequency separation that sometimes correlates with the neutron star spin frequency. In systems like 4U 1728–34, twin kHz QPOs were observed at frequencies around 703 Hz and 1070 Hz, providing constraints on the innermost disk radii, mass, and radius of the neutron star.

  <p>
    The study of QPOs across these frequency ranges provides a powerful diagnostic of the strong gravity regime, the properties of the compact object, and the structure of the inner accretion flow. Their energy dependence, coherence, and evolution with accretion rate continue to make them a central focus of high-energy astrophysics.
