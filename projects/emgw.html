    <h3>1. Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</h3>
    <p>
        The detection of <strong>gravitational waves</strong> from compact binary mergers—such as neutron star-neutron star (NS–NS) and neutron star–black hole (NS–BH) systems—has opened a new window into the Universe. These events, while first observed through ripples in spacetime by detectors like <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">LIGO</a> and <a href="https://www.virgo-gw.eu/" target="_blank">Virgo</a>, are also expected to produce <strong>electromagnetic (EM) counterparts</strong> across multiple wavelengths. Identifying and studying these EM signals provides crucial insights into the physics of the merger, the nature of the ejecta, and the origin of heavy elements via r-process nucleosynthesis.

    <h3>2. 170817</h3>

            <p>
                One of the most promising EM counterparts is the <strong>kilonova</strong>—a rapidly fading optical/infrared transient powered by radioactive decay of neutron-rich material ejected during the merger. The discovery of <em>AT2017gfo</em>, the optical counterpart to the first binary neutron star merger GW170817, marked the dawn of <strong>multi-messenger astronomy</strong>. Since then, coordinated efforts using wide-field and deep-imaging telescopes have been key to discovering similar events.

    <h3>3. Gold Hunting strategy</h3>
    <p>
        Facilities like the <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a> and the <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/victor-blanco-4m-telescope/decam/" target="_blank">Dark Energy Camera (DECam)</a> play a vital role in this search. ZTF enables rapid tiling of large localization regions from LIGO–Virgo alerts, while DECam provides deep follow-up to identify faint kilonova candidates. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/" target="_blank">GROWTH-India Telescope</a> contributes real-time photometric monitoring from a different geographic longitude, increasing cadence and sky coverage. These facilities work in synergy to detect and characterize EM counterparts before they fade away.

    <h3>4. Current status</h3>

              <p>
                The fourth observing run (<strong>O4</strong>) of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA collaboration began in May 2023 and continues to deliver a wealth of gravitational wave alerts. With enhanced detector sensitivity and real-time public notifications, the search for <strong>electromagnetic counterparts</strong> has entered a new era of precision and responsiveness. Among the most promising alerts is <strong>S250206dm</strong>, a high-significance binary neutron star (NS–NS) merger candidate reported by LIGO. The <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a> carried out wide-field tiling of the event’s localization region, while the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/" target="_blank">GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT)</a> provided targeted follow-up observations from Hanle, India. These coordinated efforts aimed to identify potential kilonova signatures and constrain the merger’s origin and properties.
